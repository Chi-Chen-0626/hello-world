# hello-world
just for fun

Hi, everyone!
I am an experienced Ph.D. in cognitive neuroscience with excellent analytical 
skills and strong quantitative background. I have hands-on experience in dealing 
with both structured and unstructured large datasets, performing data cleaning and visualization, and statistical 
modeling. I am passionate about machine learning and data science, and fascinated about combining
neuroscience with computer science to give birth to artificial intelligence.

I'm a Chinese, who is now live in Cologne region (Germany).
